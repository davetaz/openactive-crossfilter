## Step 1 - Cards to go in the data Grid

### Requirements

Boiler plate HTML, Javascript and CSS already built!

### Process

1. Download a data feed containing five records

2. Create a card displaying the information for one item. 
	* Name
	* Description
	* Age range (reference function)
	* Price range (reference function)
	* Leisure center name

By the end of this stage we have the HTML and Layout for a card. 

## Step 2 - Create the d3 data grid

Use the HTML and Javascript from above to populate the data grid with all 5 items.

## Step 3 - Create the activity row chart

## Step 4 - Create a line chart of the duration

TODO: Make a function to getDuration from the object.

## Step 4 - Create the search box

TODO: Make a generic function that takes an array of variables to add to the search string

## Step 5 - Create the map

## Step 6 - Take the line chart for duration and turn it to a slider

## Step 7 - Make a rowChart for categories 

This requires all the reduceAdd bits etc.
