## Step 1 - Cards to go in the data Grid

### Requirements

Boiler plate HTML, Javascript and CSS already built!

### Process

1. Download a data feed containing five records

2. Create a card displaying the information for one item. 
	* Name
	* Description
	* Age range (reference function)
	* Price range (reference function)
	* Leisure center name

By the end of this stage we have the HTML and Layout for a card.
