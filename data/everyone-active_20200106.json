LES MILLS™ Virtual classes are designed for people who cannot get access to our live classes or who want to get a ‘taste’ of a LES MILLS™ class before taking a live class with an instructor. The classes are played on a big video screen, with dimmed lighting and pumping surround sound, and are led onscreen by the people who actually choreograph the classes. There is a variety of virtual programs and class durations available, so check the centre’s timetable for details and give it a go!","attendeeInstructions":"Body Balance is a Yoga, Thai Chi, Pilates workout that builds flexibility, strength and leaves you feeling centered and calm.","genderRestriction":"http://openactive.io/ns#None","ageRange":{"type":"QuantitativeValue","name":"Ages 16+","minValue":16},"image":{"type":"ImageObject","url":"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod-everyoneactive-wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/26092236/Ea-Image2.jpg"},"url":"https://profile.everyoneactive.com/booking?Site=0205&Activities=2051CBB0815619&Culture=en-GB","location":{"type":"Place","url":"https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/meadowside-leisure-centre/","name":"Meadowside Leisure Centre","identifier":"0205","address":{"type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"High Street","addressLocality":"Burton-on-Trent","addressRegion":"Staffordshire","postalCode":"DE14 1TL","addressCountry":"GB"},"telephone":"01283 372960","geo":{"type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":52.804890,"longitude":-1.627880}},"eventSchedule":{"type":"Schedule","byDay":["http://schema.org/Monday"]},"subEvent":[{"type":"Event","startDate":"2020-01-06T08:15:00Z","endDate":"2020-01-06T08:44:59Z","remainingAttendeeCapacity":25,"maximumAttendeeCapacity":25,"identifier":2050061061},{"type":"Event","startDate":"2020-01-13T08:15:00Z","endDate":"2020-01-13T08:44:59Z","remainingAttendeeCapacity":25,"maximumAttendeeCapacity":25,"identifier":2050061062}],"offers":[{"type":"Offer","identifier":"OX-AD","name":"Oxygen - Adult","description":"Grp Ex - Virtual Body Bal","price":3.00,"priceCurrency":"GBP","genderRestriction":"http://openactive.io/ns#None"},{"type":"Offer","identifier":"OX-SNR","name":"Oxygen - Senior","description":"Grp Ex - Virtual Body Bal","price":3.00,"priceCurrency":"GBP","ageRange":{"type":"QuantitativeValue","minValue":50},"genderRestriction":"http://openactive.io/ns#None"}],"type":"Event","duration":"PT30M"}},{"state":"updated","kind":"session","id":"0211CRP07450318","modified":287948804,"data":{"@context":"https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld","id":"http://everyoneactivelive-openactive.azurewebsites.net/api/sessions/0211CRP07450318","identifier":"0211CRP07450318","activity":[{"type":"Concept","id":"http://openactive.io/activity-list/#2c2b9be5-9491-4958-bee8-70ced347d384","prefLabel":"Rpm™","inScheme":"http://openactive.io/activity-list/"}],"category":["Group Exercise Classes","Calorie Killers","Group Exercise - Virtual"],"name":"Virtual RPM","description":"This virtual cycling class allows you to choose how hard you want to push yourself, while still keeping up with the instructor who takes you and the rest of the class through hill climbs, sprints and flat rides.
